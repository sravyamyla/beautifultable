    <p>The history of ICANN traces back to the creation and the evolution of the Internet itself.</p>
    <p>In 1969, the first message was sent via the Arpanet, a U.S. Department of Defense network and precursor to the global Internet. Three years later, Jon Postel started to record socket numbers for the Arpanet in his notebook. His registry eventually became the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which manages the coordination of the Domain Name System (DNS).</p>
    <p>ICANN was founded in 1998 and grew out of a U.S. Government commitment to transfer the policy and technical management of the DNS to a non-profit corporation based in the U.S. with global participation. ICANN was incorporated in California on September 30, with entrepreneur and philanthropist Esther Dyson as founding chairwoman. It is a nonprofit public benefit corporation "organized under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law for charitable and public purposes. The IANA Stewardship Transition was completed in October 2016 thanks to the work and dedication of the Internet community worldwide.Ã¥ ICANN was established in California due to the presence of Jon Postel, who was a founder of ICANN and was set to be its first Chief Technology Officer prior to his unexpected death. ICANN formerly operated from the same Marina Del Rey building where Postel formerly worked, which is home to an office of the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California.</p>
