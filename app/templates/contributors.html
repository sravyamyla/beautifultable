    It uses the social graph to figure out how the person related to the other and not only this it wanted to expand its area for software developers to build softwares completely on web along the way they came across idea of advertising. Justin Frankel and Cabel Sasser created downloadable media players Audion and Winamp. This softwares helped people play music in the form of mp3s on their computers. Earlier people used to have to buy CDs to listen to the music which they wanted to listen to but David Weekly got an idea to distribute music through the internet. David Weekly as a freshman launched an mp3 information website with downloadables and it was a great success for him as he got huge responses. At first it was difficult to find the music the people wanted. The music industry didn't expect that it would impact there business at first. The idea of distributing music was about to go mainstream in a massive way through software named Napster. Napster allowed its users to share music from their own computer to others and vice versa. People just had to type the name of the song to get it downloaded. Napster driven mp3 downloads were taking 75 to 80% of the available bandwidth of US universities.It became one of the fastest selling software ever. But the distribution of free music was not accepted by the head of the recording industry association of america to protect the revenues of the music industries. Napster was told to filter out the copy right songs. First one to oppose Napster were Howard King and Peter Paterno top Los Angeles entertainment lawyers because they saw a huge amount of file sharing was going on for free. They also asked their clients to help them to stop napster as it was also dangerous for them. Metallic wanted some 300000 Napster users banned from using the website, they also brought with them the names of those people as a proof. Metallic look was like a greedy band in front of a napster. Then RIAA also filed a lawsuit against Napster due to the copyright in the digital age. Music industry won against napster and napster had to shut down. From this Steve Jobs got an idea to create an iTunes Music store where songs were sold 99 cents a piece with strict copy protection. Also there was file suit against youtube it was not that easy to bring down as Google had brought youtube. Opponents feared that there would be a rise in entertainment in YouTube itself which would alienate the audience from the mainstream. With the rise of Web 2.0 there was a great clash between Facebook and Myspace for supremacy. There were also people or companies like Wikipedia and Craigslist who can't be brought. Blogging came into existence in Web 2.0 as anyone from anywhere could write anything or any reports that happened nearby. Craigslist had all the classified sections of any newspaper around the world for free. Wikipedia was a non profit organization as they proved the web is not just about making money but setting communication and knowledge free.
