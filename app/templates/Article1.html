        <p>Here’s a basic unit test for Python’s absolute value function:</p>
<p>	def test_abs_for_a_negative_number():</p>
<p># Arrange</p>
<p>negative = -5 </p>
<p># Act </p>
<p>answer = abs(negative)</p>
<p># Assert</p>
<p>assert answer == 5</p>
        <p>The qualities or attributes of an object are referred to as its properties. Although this test appears to be insignificant, we may use it to highlight our pattern. In addition, I like to include comments in the test case that describe each aspect of the test case.
</p>
           <p> 1.During the Arrange step, a variable named "negative" is created for testing purposes.</p>
<p>2.Using the "negative" variable, the Act step invokes the "abs" function, which returns a result that is stored in a variable named "answer."</p>
<p>3.The Assert step checks to see if the value of "answer" is a positive one.</p>
<p>What is the significance of testing?</p>
<p>It clearly distinguishes between what is being tested and the stages involved in the setup and verification.
Clarifies and concentrates attention on a set of test steps that has proven to be historically successful and generally essential.
Some TestSmells become more noticeable as a result of this:
Assertions are interspersed with code from the "Act."
Methods of testing that attempt to test too many different things at the same time.</p>
