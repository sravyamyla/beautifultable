       SOLID is an acronym for the first five principles of Robert C. Martin's paper Principles of Object-Oriented Design, which is an acronym for Solid Object-Oriented Design.
    </p>
    <p> The application of these principles contributes to the development of maintainable and expandable code. They also aid in the detection of code smells, the ease with which code may be refactored, and the practice of good agile development.  </p>
    <p> SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) is represented by the letter S.
The letter O stands for the Open-Closed Principle (OCP).
LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) is represented by the letter L.
The letter I stands for Interface Segregation Principle (also known as ISP).
DIP is an abbreviation for Dependency Inversion Principle. </p>
    <p> OCPD - Open-Closed Designation Principle
The ability to easily increase the functionality of our software entities without the need to change the entity itself is a desirable attribute for our software entities. </p>
    <p> LSP is an abbreviation for the Liskov Substitution Principle.
What this principle indicates is that objects in a program should be interchangeable with instances of their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program as a result of this substitution. When passing an abstraction subclass through, you must ensure that you do not change any of the behavior or state semantics of the parent abstraction. </p>
    <p> The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is an important concept in computer networking.
The goal is to keep interfaces as short as possible so that clients aren't obliged to implement methods that they don't really need or want.
</p>
    <p> DIP is an abbreviation for Dependency Inversion Principle.
When it boils down to it, this principle says that high-level modules should not rely on low-level modules, but should instead rely on abstractions. This principle makes it possible to decouple.</p>
